<h3>Welcome to Rezzi!</h3>
<h4>This segment is in welcome.component.html</h4>

<p>We (Conley and Kai) will make this look nicer as the sprint progresses, but this will be a sort of
  default welcome page with the logo or something. Right now, we have three routes set up which you can
  reach by going to:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a routerLink='/sign-up'>Sign Up</a></li>
  <li><a routerLink='/sign-up-hd'>Sign Up (HD)</a></li>
  <li><a routerLink='/sign-in'>Sign In</a></li>
  <li><a routerLink='/home'>Home</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Or if you really hate the app, you can sign out:</p>
<app-sign-out-button></app-sign-out-button>
<p>Happy coding, Team 8! :)</p>
