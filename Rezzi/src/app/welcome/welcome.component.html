<h3>Welcome to Rezzi!</h3>
<h4>This segment is in welcome.component.html</h4>

<p>We (Conley and Kai) will make this look nicer as the sprint progresses, but this will be a sort of
  default welcome page with the logo or something. Right now, we have three routes set up which you can
  reach by going to <a routerLink='/sign-up'>'/sign-up'</a> or
  <a routerLink='/sign-up-hd'>'/sign-up-hd'</a> or <a routerLink='/home'>'/home'</a>.. Happy coding, Team 8! :)</p>
