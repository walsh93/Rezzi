# Rezzi

## Problem Statement
Living in an on-campus residence hall is a great opportunity for students to make friends and connections, but it can be difficult to meet students on other floors if you are not introduced or do not have a way to contact them, given that every floor has their own unique group chat. Rezzi fixes both of these issues as an entire hall can be included in one group messaging platform that includes moderated hall-wide messaging, floor-specific groups, and channels students can create to talk about their interests with other residents of their building. Rezzi improves upon products like GroupMe or Slack by using three tiered levels of channels, allowing admin controls for residence hall staff members, and including the whole building in discussions in a controlled manner.
